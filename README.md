# Tracker Killer
This was built for experimentation purposes with the goal of inspecting how anime tracking sites deal
with users with ludicrously large libraries.

It is beneficial for testing how well these sites cope with the following:
- Initial library page load time
- Library API request serialisation time
- Library API request download size

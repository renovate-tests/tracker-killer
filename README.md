# Tracker Killer

This was built for experimentation purposes with the goal of inspecting how anime tracking sites deal 
with users with ludicrously large libraries.

It is beneficial for testing how well these sites cope with the following:
- Initial library page load time
- Library API request serialisation time
- Library API request download size

## Results

| Test                      | AniList   | Kitsu | MyAnimeList
| ------------------------- | --------: | ----: | ----------:
| Page load time (initial)  | N/A       | N/A   | N/A
| Page load time (refresh)  | N/A       | N/A   | N/A
| Render time               | N/A       | N/A   | N/A
| Paint time (onload)       | N/A       | N/A   | N/A
| Paint time (loaded)       | N/A       | N/A   | N/A
| Paint time (scroll)       | N/A       | N/A   | N/A
| API response time         | N/A       | N/A   | N/A
